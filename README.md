Here's a very simple plaintext explanation you can include as a README or instruction.

Password Breach Checker

This script checks if your passwords have been exposed in previous data breaches. 
It works by safely checking the password against the "Have I Been Pwned" database without ever sending your full password.

Requirements:
Python 3 installed.
The `requests` library (run `pip install requests`).

How to run it:

1. Download the script.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt in the script's folder.
3. Run `python password_checker.py`.
4. Enter your passwords when prompted to check if theyâ€™ve been compromised.
5. Type `exit` to quit the program.

Your passwords stay private because only a partial hashed version is checked against the database, never the password itself.
